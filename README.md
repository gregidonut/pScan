# pScan

Is a tool that executes a TCP port scan
on a list and delete hosts from the list
using the subcommand `hosts` similarly to
the [nmap](https://nmap.org/) command. It
allows you to add, list, and delete hosts
from the list using the subcommand `scan`.
Users can specify the ports using a
command-line flag. It also features command
completion using the subcommand `completion`
and manual page generation with the subcommand
`docs`.

This is mostly a project I am doing to learn
how to use the Cobra CLI framework for Go.
